                                 nnCron LITE
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~

nnCron LITE is a small, but full-featured scheduler that can start 
applications and open documents at specified time or with specified 
frequency. nnCron LITE is a perfect freeware Windows clone of a 
well-known UNIX scheduler Cron (including all the useful Anacron
features).

Here are the most important features of nnCron LITE:

  - it can be started as a system service or as a regular standalone 
    application 
  - it understands cron table format (Unix) and is managed with 
    easy-to-edit text crontab files that are fully compatible with
    Unix crontabs 
  - it can handle and restart so called missed tasks 
  - it can set and use environment variables 
  - it can run applications authorized as currently logged user 
    (WinNT/2000/XP) 
  - it can be extended with plugins written in Forth language 
  - it can be easy tuned up to answer your current needs 
  - it is not resource-demanding, and it can run even on very old PCs 
    without any noticeable performance degradation. (We have never seen 
    nnCron LITE service to allocate more than 150k of operative memory.) 
    
nnCron LITE is tiny, powerful and easy to use. And if you need not just 
a scheduler, but a full-blown automation manager, take a look at nnCron
(http://www.nncron.ru/).
